export const PLAN_TEMPLATE = `# Task
Title: <one-line summary for the dashboard>

Implement: <state exactly what to build or change>.

Explain the user-visible outcome and why it matters. This task is to be implemented.

If a decision is genuinely required before implementation can continue, write \`DECISION.md\`
in the working directory root using this block format, then stop:

## Q1
Kind: technical | product | authority
Question: <one line>
Options: <one line>
Recommendation: <one line>

\`Options:\` and \`Recommendation:\` are optional.

## Required behavior

- State the behavior that must be added or changed.
- State the observable result, including failure behavior and exit codes where relevant.

## Invariants

- State what must remain true after the change, not only the implementation steps.
- Preserve existing product behavior and supported project shapes unless a change is explicit here.
- Keep tests independent of the checkout path, current working directory, and run time.

## Out of scope

- List behavior, interfaces, defaults, and integrations that must not change.

## Test requirements

- Add assertions that fail when the requested feature is broken, with a positive control when absence is asserted.
- Do not write instructions that quietly narrow the product to make the task easier.
- Do not use fixtures that erase the signal by making correct and incorrect implementations look the same.
- Do not delete, skip, or weaken existing tests.
