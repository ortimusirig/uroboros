Act as the controller and run the real CLI from the user's current working directory:

`node "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/loop.js" mutate $ARGUMENTS`

Run it directly, never through a pipe. The process's true exit code is the result; stdout text
is not success or failure, and an exit code obtained through a pipe is never acceptable. Report
the command's true exit code and its relevant stdout and stderr to the user. Survivors are
evidence for the arbiter and do not change the meaning of a previously passing gate.
